Initial task documentation per task.
--------------------------------------
Thoughts for each task:

 > Should we be testing numbers by the python 'inf' (infinity), if so, how??
 and what is the expected result (num / 'inf') or (num * 'inf') is what??
--------------------------------------
Task 0. Integers addition

FUNCTION:
def add_integer(a, b=98):
MODULE DOCUMENTATION:
The Module is designed to supply 1 function for use, the add_integer function
FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
The function recieves 2 integers and adds them together, and returns the value.
must be integers (will type check)
Can accept floats, will convert to integers if so.
TEST CASES:
 > send through 2 integers (positive)
 > send through 2 integers (mixed)
 > send through 2 integers (negative)
 > send through incorrect type (string) (both spot a and b)
 > send through incorrect type (list of integers)
 > send through Null Values (both spot a and b)
 > send through very large numbers
 > send through chars cast as int and float
 > send through words cast as int and float

Task 1. Divide a matrix

FUNCTION:
def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
MODULE DOCUMENTATION:
This moduel is designed to supply 1 funcion for use, the matrix_divided function
FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
Function recieves a matrix(matrix) and a number to divide(div) each matrix item by.
Matrix items must be int or float and can be negative
Each matrix row must be the same size
Div must be int or float
div can't be 0
results must be 2 decimal places
TEST CASES:
 > Send through corretly formatted matrix with:
  > Send through Div (positive)
  > Send through Div (Negative)
  > Send through Div (zero)
  > send through Div (character/string)
 > send through correctly formatted div with:
  > send through matrix with negative numbers
  > send through matrix with chars/string
  > send through matrix with different size rows
  > send through empty matrix
 > send through an empy function call
 > send through a function call with only 1 parameter
 > send through correctly formatted matrix and div (positive)
 > send through correctly formatted martix and div (negative)
